# DiscordMusicBot

A simple Discord Music Bot created by [Skyy](https://github.com/Skyy2K) using [discord-player](https://npmjs.com/discord-player) and [discord.js](https://npmjs.com/discord.js) for his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN5lSg2Pm2U71gr9zZ207EQ)!

## Setup

View this video to see how to setup the bot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azMy_ttzC08

## Features

- Play music from YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, and other services.
- Use playlists.
- Set volume, pause, resume, shuffle and view queue.
- Customise most messages and max volume in config.js!

## Credits

Please do not take off the footer for the bot, it is used to recognise the original author of the bot.
We don't exactly support creating your own version and calling it "your own".
Please do not also take off/modify any credits in messages, console logs, etc as again it is used to recognise the original owner of the source code!
If you were to go under my rules (to not follow and edit the credits) I will be taking action.
Do not speak in a way like:

- "we did it"
- "this is my bot"
- "i did it"

or any form, you just set it up, Skyy created the whole code.
