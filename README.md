## Credits

Please do not take off the footer for the bot, it is used to recognise the original author of the bot.
We don't exactly support creating your own version and calling it "your own".
Do not speak in a way like:

- "we did it"
- "this is my bot"
- "i did it"

or any form, you just set it up, Skyy created the whole code.
